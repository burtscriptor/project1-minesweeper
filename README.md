Mine Sweeper Intro
==================

This is my _first_ javasscript **project**.
Loads of ___learning___ occured during its construction and I soon learnt the _importance_ of **breaking** things down into ***smaller*** parts. 

## Debugging
* Takes time and patience.
* Foundermentals such as data types are important to check.

### Tips
1. console.log/table everything

## Code 

You can Talk about variables or functions like `document.getElementById`

For longer bits of code,use triple backticks
```javascript
const hey = function () {
    console.log('Hey")
}
```
