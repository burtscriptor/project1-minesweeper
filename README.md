Mine Sweeper Introduction
==================
 [Mine Sweeper](https://burtscriptor.github.io/project1-minesweeper/)

A classic logic puzzle game with its origins from back in the [1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)).  The player is presented with a grid which may vary in size depending on the version. The grid has hidden mines which the play must discover but never uncover. Some [report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minesweeper/comments/xq08qo/was_minesweeper_really_created_for_people_to/?rdt=49089) it was developed to assist computer users to transition to a mouse with two buttons; left and right. With both buttons having differnt functions within the game. The game as told the test of time. This version was developed with a responsive design in mind to also be played on smaller screens, such as a tablet or mobile phone.

* A simple play button begins the game, including starting a timer.

* A grid of tiles. You the player **select a tile**. I hope there's not a mine under the **first one**! Use the **left click** mouse button to uncover a tile, use the **right click** mouse button to place a flag; this indicates that you suspect a mine to be under the tile. **Placing flags on all the tiles that do cover a mine, is how you win the game!**



* Tiles that have been **uncovered** can either be grey and blank, for example the top left most tile. 
* Contain a **number** which indicates how many mines are diagonal and or adajacent to it. 
* **Right clicking** on a tile you supect having a mine, **places a flag** upon it.

* If you correctly place a **flag** on a tile hidding a mine, the mine counter will go down. If you are wrong the counter will not change. Once a flag is placed you **cannot remove it!**

* **Uncovering** a mine results in a **loss** and a message saying the same. (The message is not shown in the above image).

* You may restart the game by clicking on the play button again.

**An off center _Well Done!_ greets those that clear the mine field!
You may play again by clicking the Play button.**

*    _I wonder what happens if you place flags on all the tiles?_

 **Technologies Used**: [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) are the three languages used in the development of this version of Mine Sweeper. I utlised [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - school is kool ;) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) to assit development as I am new to software engineering.


  ‚òê **Next Steps**: I think a _limbs left_ feature could be interesting? Don't you? There are still improvements to this basic version that need to be improved, not limited to but including centering the **Well done!** message.


## Epilogue
No small amount of character building (feeling like paper in a rain storm) took place during the development. 

**Key learnings**
* Debugging takes time and patience.
* Foundermentals such as data types are always important to check.
* Console.table is your best friend when using arrays.
* Writting loads of If statements can help to solve problems.
* If statements in some instances are the perfect pseudocode to map out the logic for a loop.
